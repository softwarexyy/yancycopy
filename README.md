####  yancycopy by Yancy   ####
The yancycopy software has been written by C language on Ubuntu.
I used linux system calls just like open()/read()/write.

Firstly I read a file to a buffer, 
then open the destination file , and send the buffer to it.

####   install method    #####
1. Download the package and extract it;
2. move to the correct directory and run "sudo make install;


Then you can use yancycopy as the common command on Ubuntu.
